<p>I started boxing at the beginning of 2nd grade (September 2022), 10 weeks later I went to a boxing camp. I had two trainings daily ten days straight. After a camp I felt that it gives me a lot of physical benefists so I decided to train until now. I also love to watch shows such as: UFC, KSW and many more.</p>
